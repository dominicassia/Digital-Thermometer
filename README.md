<h1>Digital Thermometer</h1>

This project displays real time temperature data.

I was originally inspired by circuit art on instagram to make a device that was more asthetic using brass rod to make the physical connections. The alternative motivation was that my apartment does not have a digital thermometer.

<h2>Materials</h2>

- Arduino Pro Micro ( 5v )
- 7 Segment Display ( Common Cathode )
- DHT-11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- Resistors ( 1 kOhm & 330 Ohm )
- 0.8mm Brass Rod

<h2>Schematic</h2>


<h2>Code</h2>

I originally planned on implementing the SevSeg Arduino Library, but I decided to create my own simple function calls.
