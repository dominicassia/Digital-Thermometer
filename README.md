# Digital-Thermometer

This project displays real time temperature data.

I was originally inspired by circuit art on instagram to make a device that was more asthetic using brass rod to make the physical connections. The alternative motivation was that my apartment does not have a digital thermometer. 

## Materials
- Arduino Pro Micro ( 5v )
- 7 Segment Display ( Common Cathode )
- DHT-11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- Resistors ( 1 kOhm & 330 Ohm )
